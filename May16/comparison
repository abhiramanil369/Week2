Single-Agent RAG:
1. Architecture: A single agent is responsible for both retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and generating the response.
2. Advantages:
    - Simple to implement and maitain due to the unified workflow.
    - Lower computational overhead as only one agent is active.
    - Faster response times since retrieval and generation are tightly integrated.
3. Limitations:
    - Limited scalability as the single agent must handle all tasks, leading to potential bottlenecks.
    - Less modular, making it harder to optimize retrieval and generation independently.
4. Use Cases:
    - Ideal for applications with small or static knowledge bases.
    - Suitable where quick responses are prioritized over systems complexity.

Multi-Agent RAG:
1. Architecture: Multiple agents collaborate, with specialized roles for retrieval and generation. Some setups might include additional agents for validation or re-ranking retrieved results.
2. Advantages:
    - Highly scalable as tasks are distributed among specialized agents.
    - Modular approach allows independent optimisationn of retrieval and generation components.
    - Greater robustness, as failure in one agent can be mitigated by fallback strategies redundancy.
3. Limitations:
    - Increased complexity in system design and coordination between agents.
    - Potential delays in response times due to communication overhead.
4. Use Cases:
    - Well-suited for large or dynamic bases that require frequent updates.
    - Optimal for applications demanding high accuracy and flexibility, such as multi-domain conversational systems.
